### **What is `scikit-learn`?**

A Python library used for **machine learning**.
It provides tools for **data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation** ‚Äî like regression, classification, and scaling.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Components & Tools

### **1. `LinearRegression`**

* Builds a straight-line relationship between input features and output.
* Finds the **best-fit line** that minimizes errors.
* Used for **simple and small regression problems**.

---

### **2. `SGDRegressor` (Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor)**

* Learns the best-fit line **step by step** instead of all at once.
* Works well for **large datasets** and **faster training**.
* Uses the **gradient descent** algorithm to minimize prediction error.

---

### **3. `StandardScaler`**

* **Standardizes** numerical data.
* Converts each feature so it has:

  * Mean = 0
  * Standard deviation = 1
* Ensures all features are on the **same scale**, improving model performance.

* Example: Suppose a person has experience = 5 years and salary = 100,000.
Without scaling, the model might think salary is more important because its values are much larger.
Using StandardScaler, we standardize both features using mean and standard deviation, so the transformed values are centered around 0 with a similar range.
This prevents the model from being biased toward features with larger numbers.

### **4. `OneHotEncoder`**

* Converts **categorical values** (like colors or Yes/No) into **0s and 1s**.
* Example:

  | Color | Blue | Green |
  | ----- | ---- | ----- |
  | Red   | 0    | 0     |
  | Blue  | 1    | 0     |
  | Green | 0    | 1     |
* Allows models to **understand categories as numbers**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Parameters & Methods

### **`random_state`**

* Keeps the **random behavior consistent** every time you run your code.
* Ensures **reproducible results**.
* A number that sets the **starting point for shuffling data so that your train-test split** is always the same every time you run the code.
* Example: `train_test_split(..., random_state=42)`

---

### **`.fit_transform()`**

* Used on **training data**.
* First **learns** from the data (`fit`) ‚Üí then **applies** the transformation (`transform`) in one step.

---

### **`.transform()`**

* Used on **test data**.
* Applies the same transformation learned from training data.
* Prevents **data leakage** (model learning from test data).

---

### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

* Measures how far predictions are from actual values.
* Formula: Average of (Predicted ‚àí Actual)¬≤
* Lower MSE = Better performance.
